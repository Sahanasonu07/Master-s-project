Objective: Enhanced the performance of IRC systems by implementing new approaches and techniques.

Key Focus: Studied the IRC protocol architecture, environment, features, specifications, implementations, and validations.

Methodology: Utilized the SPARK approach to ensure the authenticity and correctness of communication protocols.

Tools Used: Implemented the Majority Multireference (MMR) specification package in ADA SPARK for structured evaluation of
concurrent systems.

Outcome: Developed criteria for effective testing and verification processes, improving real-time communication in online
